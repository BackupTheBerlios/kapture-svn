To compile, use CMake.
You must specify the location of the headers files of the linux uvcvideo
driver in CMakeList.txt, even if you don't use this driver. (http://linux-uvc.berlios.de/)

[ALTERNATIVE]
To compile, please use the Kapture.pro file :
	qmake -makefile
and a correct Makefile will be generated.

You must have QT 4.2 installed to use this software.
You now also must have OpenSSL installed.

Have fun !
