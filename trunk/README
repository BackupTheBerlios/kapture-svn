To compile, use CMake.
To have a fully featured application, run
	cmake -DUVCVIDEO=/path/to/uvcvideo /path/to/Kapture/sources 

If you do not have nor use the uvcvideo driver, you will miss some features.
Download it at http://linux-uvc.berlios.de/

You must have QT <= 4.2 installed to use this software.
You now also must have OpenSSL installed.

Have fun !
