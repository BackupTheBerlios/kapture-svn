To compile, use CMake.
To have a fully featured application, run
	cmake -DUVCVIDEO=/path/to/uvcvideo /path/to/Kapture/sources 
If this does not work, simply run
	cmake /path/to/Kapture/sources

If you do not have nor use the uvcvideo driver, you will miss some features.
Download it at http://linux-uvc.berlios.de/ if you use an UVC compliant video camera.

You must have QT >= 4.3 installed to use this software.
You now also must have OpenSSL library and headers installed.

Have fun !
